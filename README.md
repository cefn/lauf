# Lauf

![alt text](./vector/logo.png)

Lauf offers a distinctive approach for managing application state and logic for applications written in typescript. 

Lauf addresses the same concerns of explicit state management, asynchrony, time-travel debugging and testability as Flux approaches. However it avoids the boilerplate of action constants, creators, payloads, middleware, reducers. Instead it promotes the adoption of minimal built-in language structures such as class definitions and generators.

To get started with the approach, read the [introductory tutorial](./docs/index.md)

For a worked example and discussion of comparison with redux, redux-saga and redux-saga-test-plan, see the [Example App Readme](./apps/lauf-example-async/README.md)
