<br></br>

`@lauf/lauf-store` provides a minimal reactive state-management solution, a simple substitute for Flux/Redux based on [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/).

It is incredibly lightweight and suitable for adoption with almost any server-side or client-side framework in Typescript or Javascript.

A React binding is provided by the [@lauf/lauf-store-react](https://github.com/cefn/lauf/tree/main/modules/lauf-store-react) package
