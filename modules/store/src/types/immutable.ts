/** Recursive implementation of Typescript's `Readonly<T>`.
 *
 * Unlike some implementations of immutability this approach introduces no
 * special objects and methods and typically doesn't require you to change your
 * code.
 *
 * It is used to flag and enforce immutability of a [[RootState]] and its
 * descendants - values assigned to a [[Store]] ([[Store.write]]) or retrieved
 * from it ([[Store.read]]). The type `Immutable<T>` is equivalent to applying
 * `Readonly<T>` to `T` and its descendant properties, telling the compiler that
 * no change should be made anywhere in a Store's state tree.
 *
 * Relying on Typescript's builtin `Readonly` allows the use of normal
 * javascript values and syntax, with the exception that operations which would
 * manipulate the item are disallowed by the compiler. Applications written in
 * Typescript get the greatest benefit from this approach, but javascript IDEs
 * that load typings for code-completion can also indicate violations of the
 * `Readonly` contract.
 *
 * Primitive properties are already immutable by definition. Functions are
 * treated as primitive values. All other objects and arrays have their children
 * made `Readonly` recursively.
 *
