/** A `Store` keeps an Immutable [[RootState]] - any array, tuple or object -
 * which can be changed and monitored for changes to drive an app. Make a new
 * `Store` by calling [[createStore]] with an `initialState`.
 *
 * Flagging all state references as [[Immutable]] guides IDEs to treat these as
 * [Immutable Objects]{@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object} to
 * avoid programming errors.
 *
 * ## Watching State
 *
 * Assigning a new [[Immutable]] `RootState` using [[Store.write]] notifies
 * [[Watcher|Watchers]] previously subscribed using [[Store.watch]]. This
 * mechanism ensures that app logic and renderers can track the latest state.
 *
 * ## Immutable State: Motivation
 *
 * Never modifying the state tree means when the state or a
 * [[Selector|selected]] branch of the state is the same ***item*** as before,
 * it is guaranteed to contain all the same ***values*** as before. This
 * guarantee is crucial.
 *
 * Immutability allows Watchers you write, renderers like
 * [[https://reactjs.org/|React]] and memoizers like
 * [[https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect|Reselect]] or React's
 * [useMemo()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo) to use
 * 'shallow equality checking'. They can efficiently check when changes to an
 * item should trigger a re-render or recompute - simply
 * when`Object.is(prevItem,nextItem)===false`.
 *
 * Immutability eliminates bugs and race conditions in state-change event
 * handlers. Handlers notified of a change effectively have a snapshot of state.
 * You don't have to handle cases where other code changed the state again
 * before your handler read the data.
 *
 * Finally, Immutability establishes a basis for advanced debugging techniques
 * such as time-travel debugging since every state change notification includes
 * a momentary snapshot of the app state which can be stored indefinitely.
 *

 * `Key`.
 *
 * Partitioning enables hierarchy and logical isolation of a [[Store]], so that
 * higher-level stores can be composed of multiple lower-level stores. Logic
 * relying on some `Store<T>` need not know whether `<T>` is the whole app state
 * or just some part of it.
 *
 * Partitioning can also make eventing more efficient. When a parent Store's
 * `RootState` changes, implementations can omit notifications for all
 * [[Watcher|Watchers]] of a child partition if the child [[RootState]] has not
 * changed, meaning no value within the child partition has changed.
 *
 * See also [[createStorePartition]].
