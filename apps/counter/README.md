# Counter (Typescript)

This simple Typescript app defines shared state independently of React, then binds React views and controls to it. See also the [Javascript version of this app](https://github.com/cefn/lauf/tree/main/apps/counter-js)

Visit https://codesandbox.io/s/github/cefn/lauf/tree/main/apps/counter to see the code and run it in an sandbox

See [logic.ts](https://github.com/cefn/lauf/tree/main/apps/counter/src/logic.ts) and [ui.tsx](https://github.com/cefn/lauf/tree/main/apps/counter/src/ui.tsx) to understand how it works.

Use `npm install` then `npm run start` to demo the application locally.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
