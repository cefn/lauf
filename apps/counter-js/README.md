# Counter (Javascript)

This simple Javascript app defines shared state independently of React, then binds React views and controls to it. See also the [Typescript version of this app](../counter/)

Visit https://codesandbox.io/s/github/cefn/lauf/tree/main/apps/counter-js to see the code and run it in an sandbox

See [index.js](src/index.js) to understand how it works.

Use `npm install` then `npm run start` to demo the application locally.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Note, this package should be installed and run with **_NPM_** to download
transpiled lauf packages from the registry. All the Typescript code elsewhere in
the monorepo uses **_PNPM_** and resolves lauf modules to local typescript versions.
